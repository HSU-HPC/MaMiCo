To run the tests, use the respective runtest*.sh script:
1. go to the respective build* directory.
2. edit the build*.sh script in the build* directory: set path variables such that they point to the correct location. For the MD codes ESPRresSo, LAMMPS,ls1 mardyn: install and compile the codes (as libraries).
3. leave the directory build* and call the runtest* script.
4. the tests will be executed and return error messages if they fail.

Remark on ls1 mardyn: for ls1 mardyn, a complete coupling cycle is included in one of the test cases.
Remark on MaMiCo V 1.1: The test NieTest, executed through runtest_nie.sh runs 10 cycles of a transient Couette flow simulation (using only 100 initial equilibration steps), coupling either 10 LAMMPS or SimpleMD simulations to an analytical solver. To execute this test, go through points 1-3 first. To run the test, call the script by ./runtest_nie.sh sequential/parallel LAMMPS_MD/SIMPLE_MD/LAMMPS_DPD. The option sequential/parallel decides whether an MPI parallel simulation can be used (2 processes in this case will be launched), or if a sequential version is applied. The LAMMPS runs currently only support the mode "parallel". The resulting averaged flow field data obtained from the particle simulations are stored in csv-files in the directory build_nie (col 0-2: coordinates of sampled macroscopic cell; col 3-5: velocity in this cell; col 6: avg. number of particles/mass) for every coupling cycle.
