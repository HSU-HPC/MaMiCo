This folder contains the MD simulation SimpleMD. Folder structure:

./
contains a definition file with some compile time constants and the MolecularDynamicsSimulation which puts together all algorithmic steps of a single-centered Lennard-Jones MD simulation.
Besides, boundary treatment (currently, only periodic boundaries are supported) and plotting of density profiles is implemented here.

cell-mappings/
contains callback-classes which are used to execute linked-cell wise operations in SimpleMD. Each class in this folder implements methods
  beginCellIteration() -> called at the beginning of a linked cell traversal
  endCellIteration() -> called at the end of a linked cell traversal
  handleCell(cell,index) -> called on a single linked cell
and--in case of pairwise molecule evaluations--
  handleCellPair(cell1,cell2,index1,index2) -> called once for each neighbouring cell pair cell1,cell2.
Together with the traversal mechanism of the LinkedCellService (see services/ below), this allows to separate cellwise functionality from the storage and memory management.

configurations/
contains different classes to read xml-based configuration files. General structure of configuration classes can be deduced from tarch/configuration/Configuration.h.

molecule-mappings/
contains callback-classes to execute a particular functionality per molecule. Each class containts the methods
  beginMoleculeIteration() -> called at the beginning of the molecule traversal
  endMoleculeIteration() -> called at the end of the molecule traversal
  handleMolecule(molecule) -> called for each molecule of the MD simulation.
Together with the traversal mechanism provided by the MoleculeService (see services/ below), this allows to separate moleculewise functionality from storage and memory management.

services/
contains classes to provide singleton-like functionality. The MoleculeService provides access to the molecule memory management (e.g., adding/deleting molecules from the simulation), the LinkedCellService provides access to the linked-cell structure. Both services further provide traversal schemes to access the linked cells/molecules.
Besides, the molecular properties and the distributed parallel enhancements (domain decomposition and molecule exchange across domain boundaries) are implemented here (MolecularPropertiesService and ParallelTopologyService).
