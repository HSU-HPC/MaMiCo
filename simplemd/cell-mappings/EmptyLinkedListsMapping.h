/** deletes all molecules from the list within the cells. The molecules are only removed from the lists in the cells,
 *  but are further available via the MoleculeService.
 *  After the force evaluation over all molecules, the DeleteMoleculesMapping is used to delete all molecules from the
 *  ghost cells. The EmptyLinkedListsMapping is used to clear the lists in the inner part of the simulation domain.
 *  Here, we still need to store the molecules but need to sort these molecules again into the correct cells, as soon
 *  as the time integration is carried out.
