# MaMiCo Tools
+ __debugging/compare_sim_output.py__ Compares the output generated by two simulation runs qualitatively.
Output files are paired by their suffix (`<timestep>.<extension>`) and must have matching prefixes (before first `_`).
Why? Allows for easy comparison of the simulation output between different implementations
(e.g. verify correctness of simulation after non-trivial refactoring).
+ __debugging/hash_sim_output.py__ Creates a list of hashes and output file suffixes (`..._<timestep>.<extension>`).
Why? Allows for easy comparison of the simulation output between different implementations
(e.g. verify correctness of simulation after non-trivial refactoring).
+ __plotting/plot-couette-profiles.py__ Simple but versatile script to plot couette flow profiles based on the CSV output.
+ __plotting/plot-pint-LBCouette.py__ Used to create Couette flow profile plots (average X-vel over simulation time) for a time-parallel simulation.
Plots several PinT iterations in a single plot, can be used to show convergence.
+ __mamico-cfg__ Utility script to generate basic couette.xml configurations (and additional files) for MaMiCo.
