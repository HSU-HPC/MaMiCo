This is the main folder of mamico. Folder structure:

coupling/
contains the coupling tool, interface implementations, and test cases for coupling. The test cases come with simple build scripts to allow for rapid testing. More details on the coupling tool and its source code structure can be found in coupling/README.

simplemd/
contains the MD simulation SimpleMD. SimpleMD can be compiled from the main directory using SCons. To compile, use the command:

scons target=simplemd build=release/debug dim=2/3 parallel=yes/no

For MPI-parallel simulations, you may need to adapt the paths to the MPI-lib. in ./SConstruct.
To run the simulation with a test configuration (assuming options release,dim=3, parallel=no), you can call:

./build/simplemd/release/dim3/parallel_no/gcc/gprof_no/simplemd simplemd/config3D.xml

This starts a 3D SimpleMD simulation using the configuration file simplemd/config3D.xml.
More information on SimpleMD and its code structure can be found in simplemd/README.

tarch/
contains helper classes and files, e.g. for XML parsing, or the definition of vector types.
