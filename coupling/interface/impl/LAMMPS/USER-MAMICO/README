This package can be used to couple e.g. fluid solvers to LAMMPS (as of Mar 2014) using
the macro-micro-coupling tool (MaMiCo). In order to install and successfully compile
the program, the following environment variable needs to exported:
- MAMICO_PATH: points to the directory that contains the MaMiCo trunk.
The package comprises the following files:
- Makefile, Makefile.openmpi_mamico:
  Makefiles as used in our coupling to build LAMMPS. We used LAMMPS as library.
- fix_mamico.*:
  This fix is used to hook the coupling functionality into LAMMPS.
- sorting.h, ghost_atoms.h, mamico_cell.h:
  Helper classes and functionality, e.g. to construct a Cartesian grid structure
  within LAMMPS.
- mamico_lammps_md_solver_interface.h, mamico_lammps_molecule.h,
  mamico_lammps_molecule_iterator.h:
  MaMiCo interface implementations, used amongst others by the fix_mamico.

Copy the USER-MAMICO package into your LAMMPS installation, replace the original Makefile of LAMMPS by USER-MAMICO/Makefile (or just add user-mamico to the LAMMPS Makefile of your LAMMPS installation), and build LAMMPS with this user-defined package as pointed out in the LAMMPS manual.
